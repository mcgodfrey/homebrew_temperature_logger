This is the arduino code to control a temperature logger designed for monitoring and logging temperatures in my homebre fermentation fridge. 
I have built the logger and it is currently tested and working.

- Temperatures looged to an SD card and displayed in real time
- RTC module for accurate timestamps
- Display is a 16x2 LCD for temperature display and menu
- Menu is operated via 3 pushbuttons (up, down, set)
- USB serial interface to dump the temperature log file and debugging
